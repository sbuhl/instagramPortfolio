<h1 id="buildinganinstagrambasedportfoliowithbootstrap">Building an Instagram Based Portfolio with Bootstrap</h1>

<h6 id="followingthetutorialfromsteveeveretthttps:webdesign.tutsplus.comtutorialsbuilding-an-instagram-based-portfolio-with-bootstrap--cms-22243">Following the tutorial from <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-an-instagram-based-portfolio-with-bootstrap--cms-22243">Steve Everett</a></h6>

<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>

<p>The original tutorial was used with Bootstrap V3 and with the Instagram API which is no more working. So I had to adapt the tutoriels.
Find here the adaptations I made.</p>

<p>About the design of the page and the PSD, I didn&#8217;t made much changes on it.
I followed roughly the process describe in the first part of the tutoriel : <a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/designing-a-simple-instagram-based-portfolio-in-photoshop--cms-21402">Designing a Simple Instagram Based Portfolio in Photoshop</a>. You will find my version in the PSD folder.</p>

<h2 id="1.tools">1. Tools</h2>

<p>I only used two tools :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap V4</a></li>
<li><a href="http://instafeedjs.com">Instageed.js</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I didn&#8217;t used Sass, neither Modernizr. It&#8217;s only for the exercice and I didn&#8217;t check the behavior of the website on each browser (only Chrome and Firefox).</p>

<p>Now, the build !</p>

<h2 id="2.fileandfolderstructure.">2. File and Folder Structure.</h2>

<p>Quite simple :
*css/
*img/
*index.html
*js/
*node_modules/
*package.json
*package-lock.json
*PSD
*README.md
Few explenations about each folder or file.</p>

<ol>
<li>css/ this folder contains only one file : instagramPortfolioStyle.css. Why such a complicated name and no &#8220;style.css&#8221;. Because, when I use Alfred to find a file or a folder on my laptop, if I write &#8220;style.css&#8221;, I will have ten thousands results. It&#8217;s quicker with this name :-)</li>
<li>img/ this folder contains two files : the background image of a mountain and a placeholder for the instagram account. I could delete this last one but I keep it for the explanation of the process.</li>
<li>index.html the core of our website.</li>
<li>js/ this folder contains two files : the app file with some personnal javascript and the instafeed.min.js file. The bootstraps files are in the node_modules folder.</li>
<li>node_modules this folder arrived when I installed Bootstrap via npm and the command : npm install bootstrap. But first, you have to init npm on your folder.</li>
<li>package.json and package-lock.json are linked with the instalaltion of bootstrap using npm</li>
<li>PSD folder, for you.</li>
<li>Readme.md this file :-)</li>
</ol>
